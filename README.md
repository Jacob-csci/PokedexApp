# Pokedex App
This app is a pokemon pokedex app.
Using Java and JFrame I created a GUI that connectes to a pokemon api containing data on all pokemon currently in the francise.
The user is able to search for any pokemon they want to and the api will return the picture of that pokemon, its number in the pokedex, and the typings of that pokemon.

## Future of the App
I would like for the user to be able to access more data in the future other than what is currently available.
Some features for the future -
1. The ability to read descriptions about the pokemon from any game in the francise.
2. The ability to see a pokemons base stats.
3. The ability to see a pokemons shiny version. Complete
4. The ability to see a pokemons height and weight. Complete
